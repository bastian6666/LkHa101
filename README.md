High Frequency Radio Variability of The Young Stars in the LkHa101 Cluster 

There is very little known about the high frequency (>10 GHz) variability of young stars. 
Extending models initially developed for the Sun, we have shown that the non-thermal radio
emission from flares on young stars (YSOs) have spectra which increase to high frequencies. 
This indicates the young stars will be both brighter and more variable at higher frequencies 
than at the 5 GHz to 10 GHz where they have been typically observed previously. Here we 
propose to observe the LkHa101 cluster at 22 GHz to study the emission from the young stars. 
The choice of this region is driven by the density of YSOs which allows a large number of 
targets to be observed in a small number of pointings. In addition this region has previously 
been observed at lower frequencies providing a baseline for comparing the observations at higher 
frequency. To both measure the spectral index of the emission and connect our new observations 
with the previous data, we will also observe the region at 10 GHz. In addition to the cluster 
of lower mass sources, LkHa101 itself is a Herbig Be star and so will allow us to look at the 
variability of a more massive source.
